Introduction
------------
	This assignment is based on the COVID-19 data available  on https://www.covid19india.org/. The assignment analyzes the data week-wise, month-wise and overall for various districts. The information can be used to analyze the patterns and spread of COVID-19 in various districts and in differet time periods. This document gives a brief about how to run the scripts, and the software and package requirements.

Requirements
------------
	The assignment has only few software requirements:
		* Python should be installed.
		* "pandas" library should be installed

How to run
----------
	* Open a terminal and navigate to this folder. 
	* Run the assign1.sh script using following command:
		
			bash assign1.sh
	
	* This command would run the assign1.sh script, which contains the scripts specified in each question. Each script would run and output files would be generated. 
	* The output csv files generated by the scripts would be saved in folder named "csv-files".

Key Points
----------
	* The python scripts are saved in a folder named "python-scripts". 
	* Scripts specified in each question would be automatically called by assign1.sh.
	* The python codes are run using python command and not python3.
	* The python script used for assigning ids to each neighbor in neighbor-modified.json file is given in python-scripts/modify.py . Since the ids have already been provided, this program need not to be run. 
	* The program may give some warnings while running.  
	* A report named report.tex is included. It has the details of some analysis performed on the given data using different techniques.
